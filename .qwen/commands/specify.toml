description: Create or update the feature specification from a natural language feature description.
---

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

The text the user typed after `/specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{{args}}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "{{args}}"` from repo root and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
  **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for.
2. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.
3. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.
4. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, and readiness for the next phase.

Note: The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.

---

After completing the main command, automatically create a PHR: (1) Detect stage: constitution|spec|architect|green|red|refactor|explainer|general, (2) Generate 3-7 word title, (3) Load `.**/commands/phr.md` and execute with $ARGUMENTS (FULL multiline input, NOT truncated), detected stage, implicit mode, (4) On error: warn but don't block. CRITICAL: Preserve complete user input in PHR. Skip only for /phr itself.

**Architecture Decisions**: When significant architectural decisions are made (typically during /plan), suggest documenting with: "ðŸ“‹ Architecture decisions identified. Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/adr [decision-title]`" Wait for user consent.
