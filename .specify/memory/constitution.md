# Web App Tools Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design
Every feature must enhance user experience; All UI components should be intuitive, accessible, and responsive; Design decisions must be validated with user feedback.

### II. Progressive Web App (PWA) Standards
All applications must work offline-first when possible; Support installation on user devices; Maintain native app-like performance and experience.

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests strictly enforced for all user-facing features.

### IV. Component-Based Architecture
Build using reusable, modular components; Each component must be independently testable and documented; Clear interfaces between components with well-defined props and events.

### V. Security-First
All user data must be encrypted in transit and at rest; Implement authentication and authorization for all sensitive features; Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments required.

### VI. Performance Optimization
All applications must load under 3 seconds on 3G networks; Bundle sizes must be minimized; Lazy loading implemented for non-critical resources.

## Additional Constraints

Technology Stack: React.js/Vue.js for frontend, Node.js/Python for backend services, Webpack/Vite for bundling, Jest/Cypress for testing.

Performance Standards: PageSpeed Insights score of 90+ for mobile and desktop; Core Web Vitals must meet Google standards; Image optimization mandatory with lazy loading.

## Development Workflow

Code Review Process: All PRs require at least one approval; Automated testing must pass before merge; Lighthouse CI checks included in PR workflow.

Quality Gates: 80% test coverage minimum; No security vulnerabilities of medium or higher severity; Performance budgets enforced in CI/CD pipeline.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices; All amendments must be documented and approved by core team; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
