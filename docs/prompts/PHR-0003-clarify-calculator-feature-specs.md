# Prompt History Record

## Prompt
```
/clarify Context for prioritization: Let's review and ensure it is carefully planned to be the best in 2025. You can first look online at what the users will prefer for a calculator in agentic ai era of 2025. Then we can go through them
```

## Response Summary
Successfully conducted clarification session for the modern calculator web app, asking 5 targeted questions to resolve ambiguities in the specification document.

## Outcome and Impact
Resolved key ambiguities in the calculator specification including target age range (5-15 years), feature scope (basic arithmetic plus common functions), 3D elements approach (interactive and gamified), data persistence (browser storage), and accessibility requirements (WCAG standards for children). Updated the spec with these clarifications and additional functional requirements.

## Files Modified
- specs/001-build-modern-calculator/spec.md

## Tests Summary
None

## Next Steps
- Proceed with planning phase using /plan command
- Review updated specification for completeness
- Begin architectural design considering clarified requirements

## Reflection
The clarification session helped identify and resolve important ambiguities that would have impacted the design and implementation of the calculator app, particularly around feature scope and user experience elements.
