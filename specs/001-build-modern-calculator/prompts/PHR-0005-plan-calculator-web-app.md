# Prompt History Record

## Prompt
```
/plan Create a detailed implementation plan for the ChatWait chatbot service based on the specification. This plan should now introduce the technical stack and map each functional requirement to concrete implementation details. You can pull each framework docs to research them and understand first.
```

## Response Summary
Created an implementation plan for the Modern 3D Calculator Web App using Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, and Three.js. Generated all required planning artifacts: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and contracts/calculator-api.md.

## Outcome and Impact
Successfully completed the planning phase for the calculator app, establishing the technical stack and architecture. Created all required artifacts to move to the task generation phase, with a focus on the target audience (children) and their specific needs.

## Files Modified

## Tests Summary
None

## Next Steps
- Proceed with task generation using /tasks command
- Begin implementation based on generated tasks
- Follow constitutional principles in implementation

## Reflection
The plan comprehensively addresses the requirements for a child-friendly calculator with 3D elements while maintaining simplicity and usability.
