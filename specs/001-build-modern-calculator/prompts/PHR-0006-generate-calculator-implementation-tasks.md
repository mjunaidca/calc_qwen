# Prompt History Record

## Prompt
```
/tasks Context for task generation: Now let's plan the implementation. We use pnpm package maanger and use commans to initialize project and maange dependencies. Each task must be small, and directly linked to a requirement in the spec.

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.
```

## Response Summary
Generated detailed implementation tasks for the Modern 3D Calculator Web App, following TDD approach with setup, test, implementation, integration, and polish phases.

## Outcome and Impact
Created comprehensive task list with 44 specific tasks organized in phases, following the specified technology stack and requirements from the specification. Tasks follow TDD approach with tests preceding implementation.

## Files Modified
- specs/001-build-modern-calculator/tasks.md

## Tests Summary
None

## Next Steps
- Proceed with implementation following the generated tasks
- Execute tasks in the specified order and phases
- Follow constitutional principles during implementation

## Reflection
The task list provides a clear roadmap for implementing the calculator app with appropriate phases and dependencies.
