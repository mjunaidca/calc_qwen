# Prompt History Record

## Prompt
```
Now let's update the tasks. FOr web apps we can skip test first approach to focus on UX expeirence.
```

## Response Summary
Updated the tasks.md file to prioritize UX experience first, reorganizing tasks to implement core UI components before extensive testing, while ensuring all requirements are still met.

## Outcome and Impact
Modified the task sequence to focus on UX implementation first rather than strict TDD approach, while still maintaining comprehensive test coverage later in the process. All functional requirements from the specification are addressed, with special attention to the critical division-by-zero error handling.

## Files Modified
- specs/001-build-modern-calculator/tasks.md

## Tests Summary
Tests now come after core implementation to allow for faster UX iteration

## Next Steps
- Proceed with implementation following the updated task order
- Focus on creating a great user experience first
- Add comprehensive testing after core functionality is implemented

## Reflection
The updated task list balances the need for rapid UX development with proper testing and implementation of all functional requirements.
