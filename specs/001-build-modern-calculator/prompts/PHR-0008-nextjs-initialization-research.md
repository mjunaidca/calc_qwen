# Prompt History Record

## Prompt
```
/phr From T002=T005 we are manually setting up project. Using context 7 mcp server and pull nextjs docs to undertand how to initlized it and same for all - what comes with it. We have to efficiently develop our web app like an MIT graduated ai engineer.
```

## Response Summary
Recording the research and planning phase for efficient Next.js project initialization using Context7 MCP server to pull documentation.

## Outcome and Impact
Captured the approach for using Context7 MCP server to efficiently research Next.js initialization and project setup, enabling better understanding of the framework's capabilities and best practices.

## Files Modified
- specs/001-build-modern-calculator/tasks.md

## Tests Summary
None

## Next Steps
- Use Context7 MCP server to pull Next.js documentation
- Research efficient project initialization patterns
- Apply MIT-level engineering practices to project setup
- Proceed with T002-T005 tasks based on research

## Reflection
Leveraging documentation servers like Context7 MCP can significantly improve development efficiency by providing quick access to authoritative documentation.
