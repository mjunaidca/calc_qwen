# Research: Modern 3D Calculator Web App

## Technology Research Findings

### Next.js 15
- **Decision**: Use Next.js 15 as the primary framework
- **Rationale**: Provides excellent performance, built-in optimization features, and great developer experience. Supports both client and server components, has built-in image optimization, and provides excellent SEO capabilities.
- **Alternatives considered**: 
  - React + Vite: More lightweight but lacks Next.js features
  - Remix: Good but less mature ecosystem
- **Key features to leverage**: 
  - App Router for layout management
  - Built-in image optimization
  - Static and server-side rendering capabilities
  - API routes for any future backend needs
  - Fast Refresh for development

### Tailwind CSS
- **Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Rationale**: Provides utility-first approach that enables rapid UI development. Works exceptionally well with children's design requirements as it allows for easy responsive and accessibility adjustments.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Styled-components: More flexible but can lead to larger bundles
  - CSS Modules: More traditional but requires more code
- **Key features to leverage**:
  - Responsive design utilities for mobile-first approach
  - Accessibility-first design patterns
  - Custom color palettes suitable for children
  - Easy-to-override classes for theming

### shadcn/ui
- **Decision**: Use shadcn/ui for accessible UI components
- **Rationale**: Provides accessible, customizable components that follow best practices. Works well with Tailwind CSS and is specifically designed for accessibility which is important for our target audience (children with varying abilities).
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Headless UI: More control but requires more implementation work
  - Radix UI: Good but less customization than shadcn/ui
- **Key features to leverage**:
  - Accessible-by-default components
  - Easy customization to match child-friendly design
  - No external dependencies (except Radix and Framer Motion)

### Framer Motion
- **Decision**: Use Framer Motion for animations
- **Rationale**: Provides production-ready animation library that works seamlessly with React. Perfect for creating engaging, child-friendly animations and interactions. Supports both simple and complex animations with good performance.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - React Spring: More physics-based but steeper learning curve
  - CSS animations: Limited functionality
- **Key features to leverage**:
  - Gesture support for touch interactions
  - Layout animations for responsive design
  - Reduced motion support for accessibility
  - Performance-optimized animations

### Three.js
- **Decision**: Use Three.js for 3D elements
- **Rationale**: Most popular and well-documented 3D library for the web. Large ecosystem with many examples and tutorials. Perfect for creating engaging 3D calculator elements that will appeal to children.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Babylon.js: Good alternative but smaller community
  - A-Frame: More high-level but less control
- **Key features to leverage**:
  - WebXR support for future VR/AR capabilities
  - Good performance with proper implementation
  - Rich ecosystem of helpers and libraries
  - Compatibility with React through react-three-fiber

### Additional Research: Child-Friendly UI Guidelines
- **Decision**: Implement guidelines for child-friendly interface
- **Rationale**: Children aged 5-15 have different interaction patterns and needs compared to adults. Larger touch targets, clear visual feedback, and simple navigation improve usability.
- **Key findings**:
  - Minimum touch target size of 48px
  - High contrast for visual accessibility
  - Clear feedback for all interactions
  - Large, readable fonts
  - Intuitive, minimal interface
  - Consistent interaction patterns

### Browser Storage Implementation
- **Decision**: Use localStorage for recent calculations storage
- **Rationale**: For a calculator app that saves recent calculations, localStorage provides simple, persistent storage that works offline. sessionStorage could be used for temporary storage, but localStorage is better for the "recent calculations" feature.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - IndexedDB: More complex for simple use case
  - Cookies: Not appropriate for client-side data storage
- **Key features to leverage**:
  - Simple API for CRUD operations
  - Automatic persistence between sessions
  - No backend requirements
