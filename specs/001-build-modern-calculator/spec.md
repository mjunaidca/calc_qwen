- Q: Should the calculator support advanced mathematical functions beyond basic arithmetic? → A: Basic arithmetic plus common functions
- Q: For the 3D elements and animations, should these be subtle visual enhancements or more interactive/gamified elements? → A: Interactive and gamified elements
- Q: What type of data persistence is needed for the calculator? → A: Browser storage to save recent calculations
- Q: Are there specific accessibility requirements beyond the standard child-friendly design? → A: Standard accessibility standards (WCAG) for children

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a child aged 5-15, I want to use a fun and engaging calculator that feels different from traditional calculators. I should be able to easily find and press buttons on mobile devices, and the interactive 3D elements and gamified animations should make the math experience enjoyable while still being functional and reliable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the calculator web page on my mobile device, **When** I touch a number button, **Then** the number appears on the display with a visual feedback animation
2. **Given** I have entered numbers and an operation, **When** I press the equals button, **Then** the result is calculated and displayed with an engaging animation
3. **Given** I am using the calculator, **When** I make an error like dividing by zero, **Then** I receive a child-friendly error message and can continue using the calculator

### Edge Cases
- What happens when very long calculations are entered?
- How does system handle multiple rapid button presses?
- What happens when rotating the device from portrait to landscape?
