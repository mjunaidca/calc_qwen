- [ ] T034 [P] Add unit tests for calculation engine
- [ ] T035 [P] Add unit tests for storage utilities
- [ ] T036 [P] Add integration tests for complete calculator flow
- [ ] T037 [P] Add end-to-end tests for main user scenarios
- [ ] T038 [P] Contract test for calculator engine API in tests/unit/calculation-engine.test.ts
- [ ] T039 [P] Contract test for storage interface in tests/unit/storage.test.ts
- [ ] T040 [P] Integration test for calculator flow in tests/integration/calculator-flow.test.ts
- [ ] T041 [P] End-to-end test for basic calculator operations in tests/e2e/calculator-basic-operations.test.ts
- [ ] T042 [P] Integration test for user session in tests/integration/user-session.test.ts
- [ ] T043 Update documentation in README.md
- [ ] T044 Performance optimization: minimize bundle size to under 100KB, ensure 3s load time on 3G
- [ ] T045 Implement PWA features: service worker, offline support
- [ ] T046 Add loading states and visual feedback animations
- [ ] T047 Verify 80% test coverage as required by constitution
- [ ] T048 Final round of UX testing and iteration

## Dependencies
- T008 (calculator hook) blocks T006-T007 (calculator components)
- T009 (calculation engine) blocks T008 (calculator hook)
- T021 (storage) blocks T023 (storage integration)
- T017 (gamification hook) blocks T018-T19 (gamification components)
- Implementation tasks (T006-T032) before testing tasks (T034-T042)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T006-T007 together:
Task: "Create basic calculator display component with child-friendly styling in frontend/src/components/calculator/CalculatorDisplay.tsx"
Task: "Create calculator buttons with touch-optimized UI in frontend/src/components/calculator/CalculatorButtons.tsx"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Focus on UX experience first, then add tests
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Core Implementation → 3D/Animation → Gamification → Data/Errors → Accessibility → Polish & Testing
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [ ] All entities have model tasks
- [ ] All requirements have implementation tasks
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
